# Contract-Q-A-RAG-System
This repository contains the codebase and resources for the development of a RAG system for Contract Q&amp;A, to create an autonomous artificial contract lawyer. Leveraging Langchain, a leading LLM application framework, the project aims to build, evaluate, and improve a chat interface.

## Introduction
